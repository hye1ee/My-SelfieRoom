The origin project was designed based on pure React. During consequetive 8 steps of user flow, its states were reiteratively got across child components.

> **MySelfieRoom** has a below user flow consisting of a total of 8 steps. Users can choose a number of photo **cuts**, **frame** design, **background** design in order and **take** photos with virtual background. After taking photos, users can **select** photos that they want and apply some **filters**. Finally user can **share** the photo via download in the local environment. (**Currently photo without filters is only downloadable**)

In this project, all states are managing via **Recoil** state and implemented with **Typescript** for scalability.
Additional features such as decorating will be released soon!
